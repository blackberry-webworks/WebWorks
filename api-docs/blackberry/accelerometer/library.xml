    <details>
      The accelerometer namespace is static; all of its functions/properties are used directly from the object.
    </details>
    
    <details title="Accelerometer Data Types">
      * Orientation, which represents handheld orientation with respect to the ground, for example, ORIENTATION_TOP_UP or ORIENTATION_LEFT_UP.
    </details>
    <details>
      * Raw acceleration samples, which are tuples of three coordinates: X, Y, and Z. Each raw value represents acceleration along X, Y and Z axes at a give point in time.
    </details>
    
    <details title="Accelerometer Axes">
      Acceleration sensors return G-force values along the X, Y, and Z axes, relative to the ground, as follows:
    </details>
    <details>
      * X axis runs from east (negative values) to west (positive values)
    </details>
    <details>
      * Y axis runs from north (negative values) to south (positive values)
    </details>
    <details>
      * Z axis runs from the front of the BlackBerry device (negative values) to the back of the device (positive values).
    </details>
    <details>
      For example, if the handheld is lying flat on a table, the X and Y values are equal to 0, while Z is equal to 1000 (which represents G-Force, or 9.80665m/sec2).
      In freefall, all three values are equal to 0. The G-Force value is specified by blackberry.accelerometer.Orientation.G_FORCE_VALUE constant.
    </details>
    
    <details title="Hardware Limitations">
      * Maximum acceleration measured - typically 2 * G, but is hardware dependant.
    </details>
    <details>
      * Sensitivity - since acceleration is never a constant the sensor may provide duplicate values
    </details>
    
    <details title="Battery Considerations">
      Subscribing to accelerometer sensor readings is costly for the device battery, and should therefore only be used only when necessary. We recommend setting the xyzBufferSize to
      a larger number and batch processing the samples once they are retrieved. Keeping xyzBufferSize equal to 1 will attempt to provide realtime readings but it is a very expensive
      operation in terms of processing and battery power.
